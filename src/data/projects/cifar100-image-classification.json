  "description": "I used the CIFAR100 dataset for object recognition with two Machine Learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). I trained my models on the CIFAR100 training data and then predicted labels for the test images. Based on those predictions, I evaluated the accuracy of my models and analyzed the confusion matrices, finally comparing the performance of the two models. The SVM achieved 37.62% accuracy for coarse categories, while fine labels were predicted with a slightly lower accuracy of 26.46%. This result was expected because fine labels represent precise object categories, whereas coarse labels represent broader supercategories. In contrast, the CNN performed better, achieving 43.84% accuracy for supercategories and 30.75% for fine labels.",
